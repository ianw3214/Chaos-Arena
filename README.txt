======================
== RUNNING THE GAME ==
======================

Unzip the zip file and run the executable! Make sure to allow the network to go through your firewall if prompted.

If the game isn't loading, give it about 15 to 20 seconds because the server may be idling from inactivity. If it doesn't load after that, restart the game and try again.

If the game still doesn't load, the server may be shut down, in which case you can just contact me to start the server if you really want to try the game out <3

===============
== THE THEME ==
===============

Not many games these days focus on the fun aspect of a game by flooding themselves with mechanics like score or ranks. The goal of Chaos Arena is to bring back the having fun with your friends on the couch kind of experience, but make it an online experience so that physically being together is not a restriction.

== NOTES ==
===========

There are many known bugs in the game, sometimes the players teleport around the map and sometimes they don't even show up at all. 
Sometimes the bugs go away after restarting the game OR by getting better connection, so if the game isn't running well, these solutions might be worth a try.
